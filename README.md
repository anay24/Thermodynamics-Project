Objective: The paper aims to investigate the sustainability of the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder Engine by analyzing its Otto Cycle with isooctane as the fuel source. The goal is to reduce the pollutants carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (NO) produced by the engine while maintaining a functional power output of at least 90% of the baseline.

Method: The study uses a computational analysis of the Otto Cycle for a closed system with varying initial conditions and engine parameters, such as pressure, temperature, compression ratio, bore diameter, and stroke length. The analysis calculates the power output and pollutant levels for different scenarios using MATLAB and GASEQ.

Results: The optimized engine parameters were found to be a stoichiometry of 0.8, a compression ratio of 7.375, a bore diameter of 0.1175 meters, and a stroke length of 0.2325 meters. The redesigned engine model produced 78.016 kW per cylinder per cycle, consumed 0.139 grams of fuel per cycle per cylinder, and had an efficiency of 57.28%. The pollutant production rates were 14.52 g/s for NO and 5.42 g/s for CO, resulting in a total pollutant mass production rate of 19.94 g/s.

Implications: The findings suggest that significant reductions in pollutant emissions can be achieved while maintaining a reasonable level of power output. The results can inform future designs of more sustainable piston-based engines and contribute to efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing harmful emissions from combustion engines.
